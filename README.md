# HHousen PicoCTF-2022 Writeup

Write-ups for various challenges from the 2022 [picoCTF competition](https://play.picoctf.org/events/70).

During the competition period, which was held between March 1tth, 2022 and March 29th, 2022, I placed **x out of x** (**top x%**) among global participants (who solved at least one challenge) as a **solo player** with a score of **x points**.

This page contains my write-ups for completed challenges that I couldn't solve in a few minutes. For example, many of the easier/straightforward challenges do not have a corresponding writeup. Additionally, write-ups were written such that they would be the most useful to my future self. Thus, easier challenge write-ups may contain relatively little information.

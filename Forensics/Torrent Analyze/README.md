# Torrent Analyze

## Challenge

SOS, someone is torrenting on our network. One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like `picoCTF{filename}`. [Captured traffic](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/206/torrent.pcap) ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220325004713/https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/206/torrent.pcap)).

## Solution

Opening the file in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) we see some TLS, TCP, DNS, and UDP connections. DNS requests are made to `torrent.ubuntu.com` and `ipv6.torrent.ubuntu.com`. We can visit those domains and find a [tracker index](https://ipv6.torrent.ubuntu.com/tracker_index) with `.torrent` files available for download.

Looking at the [description of a `.torrent` file on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_file) gives us a general overview of the file structure, but isn't overly helpful. [The article linked in the hints](https://www.techworm.net/2017/03/seeds-peers-leechers-torrents-language.html) explains that "A user who wants to upload a file first creates a small torrent descriptor file that they distribute by conventional means (web, email, etc.). They then make the file itself available through a BitTorrent node acting as a seed." This indicates that the `.torrent` file would contain the file name. If we download a random torrent file from the Ubuntu [tracker index](https://ipv6.torrent.ubuntu.com/tracker_index), we see that this is indeed the case. However, HTTPS is used to download this file so without the TLS key, which we don't have, we cannot read this file.

After looking through the UDP streams in Wireshark using the `Right click > Follow > UDP Stream` we notice that there are several streams that look like the following in ASCII:

```
d1:ad2:id20:...AK..w]}..hf...:..9:info_hash20:.F|.....A6{."0....X.e1:q9:get_peers1:t4:gp.#1:y1:qed1:rd2:id20:..0[.'..7.*}..YE.e .5:nodes208:.f.I........<..>.$^R/*..i6..>+..	..._P+.

```

We also searched online for "torrent pcap" and found [this article](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2013/09/14/index.html) ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220325011426/https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2013/09/14/index.html)). The article states that we can "easily filter traffic to find any torrent hashes of the files being downloaded or shared." It also says that "a Google search on the torrent hash will often tell you what the file is," which sounds exactly like what we want since we want to know the name of the file being downloaded as a torrent.

However, Wireshark will not interpret the traffic as bittorrent traffic for some reason, so we have to manually find this torrent hash.

Searching for "BT-DHT" (which was given in a hint) finds the [Mainline DHT Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT), which states "Mainline DHT is the name given to the Kademlia-based distributed hash table (DHT) used by BitTorrent clients to find peers via the BitTorrent protocol." It also says "The SHA-1 hash of a torrent, the infohash, is synonymous with a Kademlia key, which is used for finding peers (values) in the overlay network. To find peers in a swarm, a node sends a get_peers query with the infohash as key (equivalent to a Kademlia FIND_VALUE) to the closest known nodes (with respect to the key distance)." So, if we can figure out what the "info hash" is we can Google the hash (according to [the previously reference article](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2013/09/14/index.html)) and get the file name.

We use the Wireshark search feature to search packet bytes, narrow & wide, for the string `info_hash`. For example, we find the hash `17d62de1495d4404f6fb385bdfd7ead5c897ea22`, which is not the file we want since it doesn't end in `.iso`. Luckily, at the end of the file we see the same hex characters after the `info_hash:` text:

```

```

From this hex-ascii dump, we see that the info hash is `e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e`. Searching for this hash finds [this page](https://linuxtracker.org/index.php?page=torrent-details&id=e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e), which states that the name is `ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso`. There are also references to that name from other pages in the Google search results. So we have found the flag.

Searching for "d1:ad2" online (the start of the packets we kept seeing) reveals that is what a BitTorrent payload begins with. We also find the [DHT Protocol specification](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html), which explains how the `get_peers` function that we observed works (notice the `get_peers` in the ascii dumps).

### Flag

`picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}`

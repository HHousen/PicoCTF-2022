# buffer overflow 3

## Challenge

Do you think you can bypass the protection and get the flag? It looks like Dr. Oswal added a stack canary to this [program](./vuln) to protect against buffer overflows. You can view source [here](./vuln.c). And connect with it using: `nc saturn.picoctf.net 57032`

## Solution

This challenge is almost identical to [CanaRy](https://github.com/HHousen/PicoCTF-2019/tree/master/Binary%20Exploitation/CanaRy) from PicoCTF 2019. Here is another writeup for [CanaRy](https://github.com/Dvd848/CTFs/blob/master/2019_picoCTF/CanaRy.md) and here is a writeup for the [nearly identical challenge from PicoCTF 2018](https://github.com/Dvd848/CTFs/blob/master/2018_picoCTF/buffer%20overflow%203.md).

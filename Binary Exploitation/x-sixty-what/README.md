## Challenge

Overflow x64 code Most problems before this are 32-bit x86. Now we'll consider 64-bit x86 which is a little different! Overflow the buffer and change the return address to the flag function in this [program](./vuln). [Download source](./vuln.c). `nc saturn.picoctf.net 61827`

## Solution

This challenge is almost identical to [NewOverFlow-1](https://github.com/HHousen/PicoCTF-2019/tree/master/Binary%20Exploitation/NewOverFlow-1) from PicoCTF 2019. [This writeup](https://github.com/Dvd848/CTFs/blob/master/2019_picoCTF/NewOverFlow-1.md) explains why we need to return to `main` before returning to `flag`.

### Flag

`picoCTF{b1663r_15_b3773r_11c407bc}`

# buffer overflow 1

## Challenge

Control the return address. Now we're cooking! You can overflow the buffer and return to the flag function in the [program](./vuln). You can view source [here](./vuln.c). And connect with it using `nc saturn.picoctf.net 62849`

## Solution

This is a basic buffer overflow where we overwrite the return address of `vuln` to the address of `win`. See the exploit [script.py](script.py) for more information.

### Flag

`picoCTF{addr3ss3s_ar3_3asy_ad2f467b}`

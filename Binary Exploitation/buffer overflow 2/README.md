# buffer overflow 2

## Challenge

Control the return address and arguments This time you'll need to control the arguments to the function you return to! Can you get the flag from this [program](./vuln)? You can view source [here](./vuln.c). And connect with it using `nc saturn.picoctf.net 50541`

## Solution

This challenge is almost identical to [OverFlow 2](https://github.com/HHousen/PicoCTF-2019/tree/master/Binary%20Exploitation/OverFlow%202) from PicoCTF 2019. However, we use ROP for this exploit since it is easy with [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools). Alternatively, the method from the link above should work too.

### Flag

`picoCTF{argum3nt5_4_d4yZ_b3fd8f66}`

## Challenge

Undefined behaviours are fun. It looks like Dr. Oswal allowed buffer overflows again. Analyse this [program](./vuln) to identify how you can get to the flag. You can view source [here](./vuln.c). And connect with it using `nc saturn.picoctf.net 63957`

## Solution

Please see the solution [script.py](./script.py).

### Flag

`picoCTF{Cle4N_uP_M3m0rY_8d5089b9}`
